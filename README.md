# Weather App

A simple weather app built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Axios**, and **EJS**, that fetches weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and displays it in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- Fetches and displays current weather information for a given city.
- Utilizes **Axios** for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.
- Uses **EJS** as the templating engine for rendering weather data dynamically.
- Employs **dotenv** to securely manage API keys in a `.env` file.
- Basic error handling for failed API requests or invalid cities.
  
## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- **API Key**: You will need an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Create a `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your OpenWeather API key as follows:

```plaintext
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real API key from OpenWeather.

### 4. Run the Server

Once the API key is set up, start the server by running:

```bash
node index.js
```

By default, the server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 5. Access the Weather App

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You can add a query parameter `city` to search for weather in different cities. For example:

```
http://localhost:3000/?city=New York
```

If no city is provided, the app will default to **London**.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
- **EJS**: Templating engine used to generate HTML with JavaScript.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from `.env` files.
- **Git**: Version control system.

## API Used

- **[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)**: Provides current weather data for any location, including over 200,000 cities.

## Version Control

This project uses **Git** for version control. To clone this project, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chirayumishra24/weather-app.git
```

Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files such as `.env` and `node_modules`.
